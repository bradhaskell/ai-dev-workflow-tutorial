## Why This Matters

### The Industry Has Changed

Software development in 2025 looks fundamentally different than it did just two years ago. AI coding assistants have moved from novelty to necessity. Companies expect new hires to work effectively with AI tools, and those who can are dramatically more productive.

**This is not about replacing developers — it's about amplifying them.**

Developers who use AI assistants effectively:
- Ship features faster while maintaining quality
- Spend less time on boilerplate and more on creative problem-solving
- Debug issues more efficiently with AI-powered analysis
- Learn new technologies faster with AI as a teaching partner

### Professional Workflows Create Professional Results

Every successful software team follows a structured workflow. This isn't bureaucracy — it's how teams coordinate, maintain quality, and move quickly without breaking things.

│  • "Is this the latest?"        • Single source of truth    │
│  • "What broke it?"             • Easy to trace and fix     │
│  • "What are we building?"      • Clear requirements        │
│  • Chaos at scale               • Scales to any team size   │

```

The workflow you learn in this tutorial is used at companies from startups to Fortune 500:
- **GitHub** for code (used by 100M+ developers)
- **Jira** for task tracking (used by 65K+ companies)
- **Pull requests** for code review (industry standard)
- **Branch-based development** (universal practice)

### Your Competitive Advantage

By completing this tutorial, you will have skills that many working developers are still acquiring:

1. **AI-Assisted Development**: Using Claude Code as a thinking and implementation partner
2. **Spec-Driven Development**: Turning requirements into code systematically
3. **Full Traceability**: Connecting every line of code to a business requirement
4. **Industry Tooling**: Hands-on experience with the tools companies actually use

These are not "student skills" — these are professional skills that will set you apart in interviews and on the job.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Move from a tracked task to merged production-ready code
- Use Claude Code as a thinking and implementation assistant
- Maintain full traceability: Jira issue → branch → commit → PR → merge
- Apply spec-driven development using GitHub's spec-kit

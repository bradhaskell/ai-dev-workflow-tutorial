# Tutorial Overview

## Why You Are Here

### The Most In-Demand Skill Set of 2025

The software industry is undergoing its biggest transformation since the introduction of the internet. AI-assisted development has moved from experimental to essential. Companies are actively seeking developers who can work effectively with AI tools — and struggling to find them.

**You are learning this skill now, at the beginning of your career.** This puts you ahead of many experienced developers who are still adapting.

Consider what AI-assisted development enables:

| Traditional Approach | AI-Assisted Approach |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Google for solutions, copy from Stack Overflow | Ask Claude Code to explain and implement |
| Hours debugging with print statements | AI analyzes errors and suggests fixes |
| Write boilerplate code manually | AI generates scaffolding, you focus on logic |
| Learn frameworks by reading documentation | AI teaches you as you build |
| Work alone, limited by your knowledge | AI as a knowledgeable pair programmer |

### The Professional Workflow You Will Master

Every technology company — from startups to Google, Meta, and Microsoft — uses a variation of this workflow:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Industry-Standard Workflow                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  1. Requirements      → What are we building and why?       │
│  2. Task Tracking     → Break work into trackable pieces    │
│  3. Version Control   → Manage code changes safely          │
│  4. Feature Branches  → Work without breaking production    │
│  5. Pull Requests     → Review before merging               │
│  6. Continuous Merge  → Integrate changes frequently        │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

In interviews, you will be asked about Git, pull requests, and collaborative workflows. This tutorial gives you hands-on experience — not just theoretical knowledge.

### What Makes This Tutorial Different

This is not a toy exercise. You are:

- Using **real tools** that companies pay for (GitHub, Jira, Claude Pro)
- Following **real workflows** used by professional teams
- Building a **real deliverable** (a working dashboard)
- Learning **real skills** that transfer directly to your capstone and career

---

## Objective

This tutorial establishes a complete, end-to-end, AI-assisted software development workflow that mirrors industry practice. By the end, you will be able to move from a tracked task to merged production-ready code using Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub, and Jira with explicit integrations and traceability.

## What You Will Build

You will create a **Streamlit sales dashboard** for a fictional e-commerce retailer. The dashboard will include:

- **2 KPI scorecards** at the top (Total Sales, Number of Orders)
- **1 line chart** showing sales trend over time
- **2 bar charts** showing sales breakdown by category and region

```

│    (Bar Chart)             │    (Bar Chart)                 │
└────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────┘
```

The dashboard itself is just the vehicle. The real learning is the **process** you follow to build it.

## The Workflow You Will Learn

```
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌────────┐
│   PRD   │ →  │ spec-kit │ →  │  Jira   │ →  │ Branch │
└─────────┘    └──────────┘    └─────────┘    └────────┘
                                                  ↓
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌────────┐
│  Merge  │ ←  │    PR    │ ←  │ Commit  │ ←  │  Code  │
└─────────┘    └──────────┘    └─────────┘    └────────┘
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)**: Start with a written specification of what to build
2. **spec-kit**: Use AI-assisted tools to refine requirements into a technical plan
3. **Jira**: Create trackable tasks from the plan
4. **Branch**: Create an isolated workspace for your changes
5. **Code**: Build the feature using Claude Code assistance
6. **Commit**: Save your changes with a meaningful message
7. **PR (Pull Request)**: Request review of your changes
8. **Merge**: Integrate your changes into the main codebase

## Key Concepts

### Traceability

Every piece of code can be traced back to a requirement:

```
Jira Issue: ECOM-1 "Create sales dashboard"
     ↓
Branch: feature/ECOM-1-add-sales-dashboard
     ↓
Commit: "ECOM-1: add sales dashboard with KPIs and charts"
     ↓
Pull Request: Links to ECOM-1, shows all changes
     ↓
Merge: Code is now in main, Jira issue can be closed
```

**Why this matters in your career:**
- When something breaks, you can find out exactly when and why
- Project managers can track progress by looking at linked commits
- New team members can understand why code exists
- Auditors and compliance teams can verify what was built and when

### Spec-Driven Development

Instead of jumping straight to code, you:

1. **Specify** what you want to build (clear requirements)
2. **Plan** how you will build it (technical approach)
3. **Break down** the work into tasks (manageable pieces)
4. **Implement** with AI assistance (guided coding)

This approach reduces wasted effort and produces better results.

**Common mistake:** Developers who skip specification waste time building the wrong thing. AI amplifies this — you can build the wrong thing very fast. Spec-driven development ensures you build the right thing.

### AI as a Partner

Claude Code is not just a code generator. It helps you:

- Understand requirements and ask clarifying questions
- Plan your approach before writing code
- Write code with explanations
- Debug issues when things go wrong
- Learn new concepts as you work

**How to think about AI assistance:**

│  YOU provide:                  AI provides:                 │
│  ────────────                  ────────────                 │
│  • Direction and goals         • Implementation speed       │
│  • Domain knowledge            • Technical knowledge        │
│  • Quality judgment            • Pattern recognition        │
│  • Final decisions             • Options and explanations   │
│  • Accountability              • Tireless assistance        │
│                                                             │
│  TOGETHER you achieve what neither could alone.             │
│                                                             │

## Common Issues

### "Command not found" after installation

**Cause:** The terminal doesn't know where to find the new program.

**Fix:**
- Close and reopen the terminal (or restart Cursor)
- On macOS, try running `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc`
- On Windows, restart Cursor completely

### Git asks for username/password on every operation

**Cause:** Git credential helper not configured.

**Fix:**
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

Then run a Git command (like `git pull`), enter credentials once, and they will be saved.

### Python version is still old after installation

**Cause:** System has multiple Python versions.

**Fix on macOS:**
- Use `python3` instead of `python`
- Or create an alias: `alias python=python3`

**Fix on Windows:**
- Ensure "Add Python to PATH" was checked during installation
- Or reinstall Python with that option checked

### Claude Code authentication fails

**Cause:** Browser popup was blocked or session expired.

**Fix:**
1. Run `claude logout`
2. Run `claude` again
3. Ensure browser popup is allowed
4. Complete authentication

### Fork not visible in Cursor

**Cause:** Cloned the original repo instead of your fork.

**Fix:**
1. Check the remote URL: `git remote -v`
2. If it shows the instructor's repo, re-clone from your fork
3. Delete the current folder and clone again from `https://github.com/[your-username]/ai-dev-workflow-tutorial.git`

---

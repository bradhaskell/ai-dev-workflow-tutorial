## 1. Connect Claude Code to Jira

**What is MCP?** The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a way for AI assistants like Claude Code to connect to external tools and services. Think of it as a "plugin system" that lets Claude Code talk to other applications. In this tutorial, we will use MCP to connect Claude Code to Jira so Claude can read your project tasks directly.

### 1.1 Add Atlassian Rovo MCP Server

**Steps:**

1. Open Cursor and navigate to your tutorial project
2. Use the existing terminal, or open a new one (**Terminal** → **New Terminal**)
3. **If Claude Code is currently running**, type `/exit` to quit first. You need to add the MCP server before starting Claude Code.
4. Run the following command to add the Atlassian Rovo MCP server:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport sse atlassian https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse
   ```

   You'll see a message confirming the server was added to your config.

5. Start Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

6. Verify the server is registered by typing:
   ```
   /mcp
   ```
   You should see `atlassian` listed. It will likely show that it requires authentication.

7. Use the **up/down arrow keys** to select `atlassian`, then press **Enter/Return** to authenticate.

8. A browser window will open for authentication:
   - Log in with your Atlassian account
   - Authorize Claude Code to access your Jira workspace
   - Return to the terminal

9. Test the connection by asking:
   ```
   What Jira projects do I have access to?
   ```

10. Claude should now list your ECOM project. You'll see something like:

   | Key | Name | Type |
   |-----|------|------|
   | ECOM | E-Commerce Analytics | Software (Team-managed) |

**Checkpoint:** Claude Code can see your Jira workspace and ECOM project.

**Note:** You may need to re-authenticate occasionally. If Claude reports it cannot access Jira, run `/mcp` to check the Atlassian server status. If it shows authentication is required, use the arrow keys to select `atlassian` and press **Enter/Return** to re-authenticate.

---

## 2. Spec-Kit Workflow

[Spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) follows a structured process: Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation.

### 2.1 Initialize Spec-Kit

First, initialize spec-kit in your project.

**In Cursor's terminal** (not inside Claude Code), run:

```bash
specify init . --ai claude
```

This creates the necessary configuration files for spec-kit to work with Claude Code, including the slash commands you will use in the following steps.

**Checkpoint:** Verify the initialization succeeded:

1. You should see output confirming the initialization completed
2. A `.specify/` directory should now exist in your project
3. A `.claude/commands/` directory should be created with the spec-kit slash commands

To verify, run in the terminal:
```bash
ls -la .specify/
ls -la .claude/commands/
```

You should see files like `speckit.constitution.md`, `speckit.specify.md`, etc. in the `.claude/commands/` directory.

**Important:** The slash commands (`/speckit.constitution`, `/speckit.specify`, etc.) will NOT work until this initialization step completes successfully. If you don't see these directories, re-run the `specify init` command.

---

### 2.2 Create the Constitution

The constitution establishes principles and guidelines for your project. It ensures consistent decision-making throughout development.

**Steps:**

1. In the terminal, start Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. Ask Claude to help create the constitution:
   ```
   /speckit.constitution

   Create a constitution for our e-commerce analytics project.
   The project will build a Streamlit dashboard for sales data visualization.
   Key principles should include:
   - Simplicity over complexity
   - Clear, readable code
   - User-friendly visualizations
   - Following Python best practices
   ```

3. Claude will generate a constitution file. Review the output and confirm.

**Checkpoint:** A constitution file exists in your project (typically in `.specify/` or a `specs/` directory).

---

### 2.3 Create the Specification

The specification refines the PRD (Product Requirements Document — the document in `prd/ecommerce-analytics.md` that describes what we want to build) into detailed, actionable requirements.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /speckit.specify @prd/ecommerce-analytics.md
   ```

2. Claude will analyze the PRD and create a specification
3. Review the specification for clarity and completeness

**Checkpoint:** A specification document is created with clear, detailed requirements.

---

### 2.4 Create the Implementation Plan

The plan outlines how you will build the specification technically.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /speckit.plan

   Create an implementation plan for the sales dashboard specification.

   Consider:
   - Python with Streamlit for the web app
   - Pandas for data handling
   - Plotly for interactive charts
   - Clean code organization
   ```

2. Claude will generate a technical plan covering:
   - Architecture decisions
   - Technology choices
   - Component structure
   - Data flow

**Checkpoint:** An implementation plan document exists with clear technical direction.

---

### 2.5 Generate Tasks

Break the plan into specific, actionable tasks.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /speckit.tasks
   ```

2. Claude will automatically parse your specification and plan, then output a list of tasks
3. Review the tasks — you should see something like:
   - Set up Python virtual environment and dependencies
   - Create main Streamlit app structure
   - Implement KPI scorecards
   - Implement sales trend line chart
   - Implement category bar chart
   - Implement region bar chart

**Checkpoint:** You have a clear list of implementation tasks.

---

## 3. Create Jira Issues

Now create Jira issues based on the tasks generated by spec-kit. This connects your work to the project management system.

### 3.1 Create the First Issue

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code (run `claude` if not already in a session), ask it to create the first issue:
   ```
   Based on the tasks generated by spec-kit, what should be the first Jira issue to create?
   Create it in the ECOM project as a Story.
   ```

2. Claude will:
   - Review the tasks from spec-kit
   - Recommend and create the first issue (likely ECOM-1)
   - Provide the issue details

**Checkpoint:** Issue ECOM-1 exists in your Jira project.

---

### 3.2 Create Remaining Issues

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code, ask it to create the remaining issues:
   ```
   Create Jira issues in the ECOM project for the remaining tasks from spec-kit.
   ```

2. Claude will create additional issues (ECOM-2, ECOM-3, etc.) for each task.

**Checkpoint:** Multiple issues exist in your Jira project based on the spec-kit tasks.

---

## 4. Build the Dashboard with Claude Code

Now you will build the dashboard using Claude Code as your AI assistant.

**What is Streamlit?** Streamlit is a Python library that makes it easy to create web-based dashboards and data apps. Instead of writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you write Python code and Streamlit turns it into a web page. It's popular for data visualization because you can go from data to dashboard quickly.

### 4.1 Set Up Python Environment

First, create a virtual environment for your project dependencies.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code (run `claude` if not already in a session):
   ```
   Help me set up a Python virtual environment for this project.
   I need to install streamlit, pandas, and plotly for a dashboard.
   Create a requirements.txt file as well.
   ```

   **What is requirements.txt?** This file lists all the Python packages your project needs. When someone else downloads your project, they can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the same packages you used. It's like a recipe that ensures everyone has the same ingredients.

2. Claude will guide you through:
   - Creating the virtual environment
   - Activating it
   - Installing dependencies
   - Creating requirements.txt

**Manual steps (if you prefer) — run these in the terminal:**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit pandas plotly

# Create requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**How do I know the virtual environment is activated?**

When the virtual environment is active, you will see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt:

```
(venv) $ _
```

If you don't see `(venv)`, run the activation command again (see Manual steps above).

**Checkpoint:**
- Your terminal prompt shows `(venv)` prefix
- A `venv` folder exists in your project
- Running `pip list` shows streamlit, pandas, and plotly installed
- A `requirements.txt` file exists

---

### 4.2 Build the Dashboard

Now use Claude Code to build the dashboard.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code:
   ```
   /speckit.implement
   ```

2. Claude will automatically use your tasks file to:
   - Analyze the CSV data structure
   - Create the dashboard code
   - Explain what each part does

3. Review the generated code. Make sure you understand what it does.

4. If Claude asks where to put the file, a common choice is:
   - `app.py` in the project root, or
   - `src/dashboard.py` in a source folder

**Test the dashboard:**

In the terminal (not Claude Code), run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

(Replace `app.py` with wherever Claude placed the dashboard file)

**What you should see:**

1. In the terminal, Streamlit shows:
   ```
   You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

   Local URL: http://localhost:8501
   ```

2. Your browser should open automatically. If it doesn't, open http://localhost:8501 manually.

3. The dashboard should display your KPIs and charts.

**To stop the dashboard:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

**Checkpoint:** The dashboard runs and displays KPIs and charts.

---

### 4.3 Iterate and Improve

If something doesn't look right, ask Claude to help:

```
The category bar chart is showing categories in the wrong order.
Can you sort them by sales value descending?
```

Or:

```
Can you add a title to the dashboard and format the Total Sales KPI as currency?
```

Claude Code can read your existing code and make modifications.

**Checkpoint:** The dashboard looks professional and displays data correctly.

---

## 5. Commit Your Changes

Now save your work with a Git commit. Claude Code can handle all the git operations for you.

### 5.1 Ask Claude Code to Commit

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code (run `claude` if not already in a session), ask it to commit your changes:
   ```
   Commit my changes for the sales dashboard.
   Make sure venv/ is in .gitignore.
   Use the Jira issue key ECOM-1 in the commit message.
   ```

2. Claude will:
   - Check the `.gitignore` file and add `venv/` if needed
   - Stage the appropriate files (app.py, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Create a commit with a properly formatted message

**What is .gitignore?** This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore and NOT track. The `venv/` folder contains installed packages that can be recreated from `requirements.txt`, so we don't need to store it in Git.

**Commit Message Format:**

Claude Code will format the commit message as: `ECOM-1: description`

| Part | Example | Rule |
|------|---------|------|
| Issue key | `ECOM-1:` | Uppercase, followed by colon and space |
| Description | `add sales dashboard` | Lowercase, present tense verb (add, fix, update) |

This format ensures:
- `ECOM-1:` — Links this commit to the Jira issue (for traceability)
- `add sales dashboard` — Describes what was added (present tense, lowercase)

**Checkpoint:** Claude confirms the commit was created with the Jira key in the message.

---

## 6. Push to GitHub

Now push your code to GitHub so it's saved in the cloud and ready for deployment.

### 6.1 Ask Claude Code to Push

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code (run `claude` if not already in a session), ask it to push your changes:
   ```
   Push my changes to GitHub.
   ```

2. Claude will push your commit to GitHub.

3. You may be prompted for GitHub credentials. If using HTTPS, enter your username and a personal access token (not your password).

**Checkpoint:** Claude confirms the push was successful.

---

### 6.2 Verify on GitHub

**Steps:**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub (`github.com/[your-username]/ai-dev-workflow-tutorial`)
2. You should see your recent commit with the message containing `ECOM-1`
3. Click on the commit to see the files you added

**Verify Jira Integration:**

1. Go to your Jira workspace
2. Open issue ECOM-1
3. Look for a "Development" panel or section
4. You should see your commit linked

**Checkpoint:** Your code is visible on GitHub and linked in Jira.

---

## 7. Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

Now make your dashboard publicly accessible by deploying it to Streamlit Community Cloud.

### 7.1 Sign Up for Streamlit Cloud

**Steps:**

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Click **Continue with GitHub**
3. Authorize Streamlit to access your GitHub account
4. Complete any onboarding steps

**Checkpoint:** You can access the Streamlit Cloud dashboard.

---

### 7.2 Deploy Your App

**Steps:**

1. In Streamlit Cloud, click **New app**
2. Select your repository: `[your-username]/ai-dev-workflow-tutorial`
3. Set the **Main file path** to `app.py` (or wherever your dashboard file is located)
4. Click **Deploy**

5. Wait for the deployment to complete (this may take 1-2 minutes)

6. Once deployed, you'll get a public URL like:
   ```
   https://[your-username]-ai-dev-workflow-tutorial-app-xxxxx.streamlit.app
   ```

**Checkpoint:** Your dashboard is live and accessible via the public URL.

---

### 7.3 Share Your Dashboard

Copy the public URL and share it! Anyone with the link can view your dashboard.

**Tip:** You can find your deployed apps anytime at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io).

## 1. Connect Claude Code to Jira

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows Claude Code to interact with external services like Jira. This means Claude can read your Jira issues directly.

### 1.1 Add Atlassian MCP Server

**Steps:**

1. Open Cursor and navigate to your tutorial project
2. Open the terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``)
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   claude mcp add --transport sse atlassian https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse
   ```

4. A browser window will open for authentication
5. Log in with your Atlassian account
6. Authorize Claude Code to access your Jira workspace
7. Return to the terminal

**Verify the connection:**

```bash
claude
```

Once in the Claude Code session, type:

```
/mcp
```

You should see `atlassian` listed as an available MCP server.

**Test the connection:**

In the Claude Code session, ask:

```
What Jira projects do I have access to?
```

Claude should be able to list your ECOM project.

Type `/exit` to leave the Claude Code session for now.

**Checkpoint:** Claude Code can see your Jira workspace and ECOM project.

**Note:** You may need to re-authenticate occasionally. If Claude reports it cannot access Jira, run the `claude mcp add` command again.

---

## 2. Spec-Kit Workflow

Spec-kit follows a structured process: Constitution → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation.

### 2.1 Initialize Spec-Kit

First, initialize spec-kit in your project:

```bash
specify init . --ai claude
```

This creates the necessary configuration files for spec-kit to work with Claude Code.

**Checkpoint:** You should see a `.specify` directory or configuration files created in your project.

---

### 2.2 Create the Constitution

The constitution establishes principles and guidelines for your project. It ensures consistent decision-making throughout development.

**Steps:**

1. Start Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

2. Ask Claude to help create the constitution:
   ```
   /speckit.constitution

   Create a constitution for our e-commerce analytics project.
   The project will build a Streamlit dashboard for sales data visualization.
   Key principles should include:
   - Simplicity over complexity
   - Clear, readable code
   - User-friendly visualizations
   - Following Python best practices
   ```

3. Claude will generate a constitution file. Review the output and confirm.

**Checkpoint:** A constitution file exists in your project (typically in `.specify/` or a `specs/` directory).

---

### 2.3 Create the Specification

The specification refines the PRD into detailed, actionable requirements.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /speckit.specify

   Based on the PRD in prd/ecommerce-analytics.md, create a detailed specification for the sales dashboard.

   The dashboard should have:
   - 2 KPI cards at the top (Total Sales, Total Orders)
   - A line chart showing sales trend over time
   - A bar chart showing sales by category
   - A bar chart showing sales by region

   The data source is data/sales-data.csv
   ```

2. Claude will analyze the PRD and create a specification
3. Review the specification for clarity and completeness

**Checkpoint:** A specification document is created with clear, detailed requirements.

---

### 2.4 Create the Implementation Plan

The plan outlines how you will build the specification technically.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /speckit.plan

   Create an implementation plan for the sales dashboard specification.

   Consider:
   - Python with Streamlit for the web app
   - Pandas for data handling
   - Plotly for interactive charts
   - Clean code organization
   ```

2. Claude will generate a technical plan covering:
   - Architecture decisions
   - Technology choices
   - Component structure
   - Data flow

**Checkpoint:** An implementation plan document exists with clear technical direction.

---

### 2.5 Generate Tasks

Break the plan into specific, actionable tasks.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   /speckit.tasks

   Generate implementation tasks from the plan.
   Create tasks that are small enough to complete in 30-60 minutes each.
   ```

2. Claude will output a list of tasks
3. Review the tasks — you should see something like:
   - Set up Python virtual environment and dependencies
   - Create main Streamlit app structure
   - Implement KPI scorecards
   - Implement sales trend line chart
   - Implement category bar chart
   - Implement region bar chart

**Checkpoint:** You have a clear list of implementation tasks.

---

## 3. Create Jira Issue

Now create a Jira issue for the dashboard task. This connects your work to the project management system.

### 3.1 Create Issue in Jira

**Option A: Use Claude Code (if MCP is working)**

In Claude Code:
```
Create a Jira issue in the ECOM project:
- Type: Story
- Title: Create sales dashboard with KPIs and charts
- Description: Implement a Streamlit dashboard showing Total Sales and Total Orders KPIs,
  a sales trend line chart, and bar charts for sales by category and region.
  Data source: data/sales-data.csv
```

**Option B: Create manually in Jira**

1. Go to your Jira workspace
2. Navigate to the ECOM project
3. Click **Create** (or the + button)
4. Fill in:
   - **Issue Type:** Story (or Task)
   - **Summary:** Create sales dashboard with KPIs and charts
   - **Description:**
     ```
     Implement a Streamlit dashboard showing:
     - Total Sales KPI
     - Total Orders KPI
     - Sales trend line chart
     - Sales by category bar chart
     - Sales by region bar chart

     Data source: data/sales-data.csv
     ```
5. Click **Create**

**Checkpoint:** Issue ECOM-1 exists in your Jira project.

---

## 4. Create Feature Branch

Now create a Git branch for your work. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase.

### 4.1 Create and Switch to Branch

**Steps:**

1. Make sure you are in your project directory in Cursor's terminal
2. Ensure you are on the main branch and up to date:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/ECOM-1-add-sales-dashboard
   ```

**Understanding this command:**
- `git checkout -b` creates a new branch AND switches to it
- `feature/` is a prefix indicating this is a feature branch
- `ECOM-1` is the Jira issue key (this enables traceability)
- `add-sales-dashboard` describes what the branch does

4. Verify you are on the new branch:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
   The current branch will have an asterisk (*) next to it.

**Checkpoint:** Running `git branch` shows `feature/ECOM-1-add-sales-dashboard` with an asterisk.

---

## 5. Build the Dashboard with Claude Code

Now you will build the Streamlit dashboard using Claude Code as your AI assistant.

### 5.1 Set Up Python Environment

First, create a virtual environment for your project dependencies.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code (run `claude` if not already in a session):
   ```
   Help me set up a Python virtual environment for this project.
   I need to install streamlit, pandas, and plotly for a dashboard.
   Create a requirements.txt file as well.
   ```

2. Claude will guide you through:
   - Creating the virtual environment
   - Activating it
   - Installing dependencies
   - Creating requirements.txt

**Manual steps (if you prefer):**

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit pandas plotly

# Create requirements.txt
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

**Checkpoint:**
- A `venv` folder exists in your project
- Running `pip list` shows streamlit, pandas, and plotly installed
- A `requirements.txt` file exists

---

### 5.2 Build the Dashboard

Now use Claude Code to build the dashboard.

**Steps:**

1. In Claude Code:
   ```
   /speckit.implement

   Build the Streamlit sales dashboard based on our specification.

   Requirements:
   - Load data from data/sales-data.csv
   - Display 2 KPI cards: Total Sales and Total Orders
   - Line chart showing sales trend over time
   - Bar chart showing sales by category
   - Bar chart showing sales by region

   Use Plotly for the charts. Make the dashboard clean and professional.
   ```

2. Claude will:
   - Analyze the CSV data structure
   - Create the dashboard code
   - Explain what each part does

3. Review the generated code. Make sure you understand what it does.

4. If Claude asks where to put the file, a common choice is:
   - `app.py` in the project root, or
   - `src/dashboard.py` in a source folder

**Test the dashboard:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

(Replace `app.py` with wherever Claude placed the dashboard file)

This will open your browser with the running dashboard.

**Checkpoint:** The dashboard runs and displays KPIs and charts.

---

### 5.3 Iterate and Improve

If something doesn't look right, ask Claude to help:

```
The category bar chart is showing categories in the wrong order.
Can you sort them by sales value descending?
```

Or:

```
Can you add a title to the dashboard and format the Total Sales KPI as currency?
```

Claude Code can read your existing code and make modifications.

**Checkpoint:** The dashboard looks professional and displays data correctly.

---

## 6. Commit Your Changes

Now save your work with a Git commit.

### 6.1 Stage Your Changes

**Steps:**

1. See what files have changed:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   You should see new files (app.py, requirements.txt, venv/) and modified files.

2. Check the `.gitignore` file — make sure `venv/` is listed (you don't want to commit the virtual environment).

   If `venv/` is not in `.gitignore`, add it:
   ```bash
   echo "venv/" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. Stage the files you want to commit:
   ```bash
   git add app.py requirements.txt .gitignore
   ```

   Or stage all changes (except ignored files):
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Verify what will be committed:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Files should appear under "Changes to be committed" in green.

**Checkpoint:** Running `git status` shows your files staged for commit.

---

### 6.2 Create the Commit

**Steps:**

1. Create a commit with a message that includes the Jira key:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "ECOM-1: add sales dashboard with KPIs and charts"
   ```

   **Understanding the message format:**
   - `ECOM-1:` — Links this commit to the Jira issue
   - `add sales dashboard` — Describes what was added (use present tense)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive

2. Verify the commit:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1
   ```
   You should see your commit with the message.

**Checkpoint:** `git log` shows your commit with the Jira key in the message.

---

## 7. Push and Create Pull Request

Now push your changes to GitHub and create a pull request.

### 7.1 Push Your Branch

**Steps:**

1. Push the branch to your GitHub fork:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/ECOM-1-add-sales-dashboard
   ```

   **Understanding this command:**
   - `git push` — Uploads commits to the remote repository
   - `-u origin` — Sets up tracking between local and remote branch
   - `feature/ECOM-1-add-sales-dashboard` — The branch to push

2. You may be prompted for GitHub credentials. If using HTTPS, enter your username and a personal access token (not your password).

**Checkpoint:** Git reports the push was successful.

---

### 7.2 Create Pull Request

**Steps:**

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. You should see a banner saying "feature/ECOM-1-add-sales-dashboard had recent pushes" with a **Compare & pull request** button
3. Click **Compare & pull request**
4. Fill in the pull request:
   - **Title:** `ECOM-1: Add sales dashboard with KPIs and charts`
   - **Description:**
     ```
     ## Summary
     - Added Streamlit dashboard for e-commerce sales analytics
     - Implemented Total Sales and Total Orders KPI cards
     - Added sales trend line chart
     - Added sales by category and region bar charts

     ## Test Plan
     - Run `streamlit run app.py` to verify dashboard works
     - Confirm all charts display correct data from CSV

     Resolves ECOM-1
     ```
5. Verify the base branch is `main` and the compare branch is your feature branch
6. Click **Create pull request**

**Checkpoint:** Pull request is created and visible on GitHub.

---

### 7.3 Verify Jira Integration

If the GitHub-Jira integration is working:

1. Go to your Jira workspace
2. Open issue ECOM-1
3. Look for a "Development" panel or section
4. You should see your branch and/or pull request linked

**Checkpoint:** Jira issue ECOM-1 shows the linked GitHub activity.

---

## 8. Merge the Pull Request

Normally, a team member would review your pull request. For this tutorial, you will merge it yourself.

### 8.1 Review and Merge

**Steps:**

1. On the pull request page in GitHub, review the "Files changed" tab
2. Verify the code looks correct
3. Click **Merge pull request**
4. Click **Confirm merge**
5. Optionally, click **Delete branch** to clean up the feature branch

**Checkpoint:** The pull request shows as "Merged" with a purple icon.

---

### 8.2 Update Local Repository

After merging, update your local main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Your local main branch now includes the dashboard code.

**Checkpoint:** Running `git log --oneline` on main shows your merged commit.
